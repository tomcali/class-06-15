//Our weather reducer! Remember, all the promise resolution has been taken care of by redux-promise. When our action hits our reducer, it will be a fully resolved promise that
//is a valid JSON object.

//first, import FETCH_WEATHER from our actions

//next, create a basic reducer with a switch statement. The initial state should be an empty array, and remember that the function will take the initial state and
//the action as its arguements. Don't forget to export it, as we will have to import it into our root/index reducer.
//Also, we will have to use ES6 destructuring via the spread operator to keep our state clean. ALWAYS REMEMBER NEVER TO MODIFY STATE.
//ALWAYS RETURN A NEW STATE OBJECT. Its as simple as `return [newState, ...oldState]`. Isn't ES6 awesome?!
