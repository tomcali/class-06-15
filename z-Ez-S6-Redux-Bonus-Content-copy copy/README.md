# Bonus Content - ES6 Deep Dive, Redux Introduction, and TDD React.

### Overview

This repository contains three days worth of class content focussed on React and the React Ecosystem. Allot at least 3 hours per lesson plan.

Originally authored to meet the local job market demands of the UT-Austin market, it can be used in lieu of curriculum content from week 23. My personal recommendation is to teach this content immediately after teaching your students React.

One exception to the above, the ES6 portion *can* be taught before React. I'll delegate this to instructor discretion.
