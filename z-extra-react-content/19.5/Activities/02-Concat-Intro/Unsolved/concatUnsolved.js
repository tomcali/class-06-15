// of your choice and console.log the result

// 2. Using the concat method, create a brand new array that combines candies and chocolates
// console log the result

let oneThroughTen = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// 3. Using the concat method, reassign the value of the oneThroughTen array to have the
// remaining numbers (5-10) added on. Make sure to save this completed array in the same
// oneThroughTen variable. console log the updated array
