# Unit 11 - Constructors & Prototypes

### Overview

This week's lesson plans take a deep-dive into constructors and the prototype chain.

### Homework

This week's homework assignment requires students to implement a "class hierarchy" using prototypes. The assignment is available in the [Homework directory](2-Homework). A reference solution is provided for the base assignment, but _not_ for the challenge.
